I am a highly motivated Business analysis graduate specialized in Data Analysis, Quantitative Finance, Econometrics, and Programming.

As a team player and quick learner, I am skilled at multitasking, critical thinking, decision-making. With a strong interest in markets and investment strategies, I have working experience in two investment banks and one technology company conducting Portfolio Financial Modeling, Market Analysis, and IPO Forecasting. Also, I am well trained in using Excel to solve logical problems in cross-functional teams and a fast-paced, multinational environment.
